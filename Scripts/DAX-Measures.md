# 📊 Analytical Logic Documentation
This document outlines the analytical logic used in the **PlayStation Multi-Gen Intelligence Hub** project.

## 🧠 DAX Usage

This project does not rely on custom DAX measures.

The dashboard was built primarily using:

- Aggregated dataset fields
- Built-in Power BI summarization
- Power Query transformations
- Visual-level filtering
- Cross-filter relationships

The objective of this project was to focus on:

- Console lifecycle comparison
- Generational segmentation
- Publisher benchmarking
- Genre revenue distribution
- Regional sales breakdown
- Title-level drillthrough experience

## 🧩 Data Modeling Approach

The analytical logic is driven through:

- Console segmentation (PS3 / PS4 / PS5)
- Regional sales columns (NA, EU, JP, Other)
- Built-in SUM and COUNT aggregations
- Cross-filter interactions across visuals
- Drillthrough-based game search functionality

## ⚙️ Future Enhancement Opportunity

This project can be further enhanced using DAX measures such as:

- Market Share %
- Generational Growth Rate
- Genre Contribution %
- Publisher Concentration Index
- Lifecycle Maturity Index
- Sales vs Metacritic Correlation

These enhancements can transform the project into a more advanced statistical analysis platform.

## 📌 Note

This project represents an early-stage analytics implementation focused on structured data modeling and interactive reporting design.

Subsequent projects in this portfolio demonstrate advanced DAX, ETL automation, and statistical modeling.
